## Coding can be intimidating!

-   Coding is like learning a new language. When you are first learning it, it all feels completely unfamiliar. I will work to support you in building the vocabulary and syntax to code in R.
-   Coding can be frustrating. I regularly lose hours of my day in trying to find bugs in my code. I will work to give you resources and skills to navigate coding frustrations.
-   Coding social environments have historically been exclusionary. I will work to reduce barriers to coding in whatever ways I can.
