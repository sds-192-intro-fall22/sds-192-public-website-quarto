# What is a dataset? {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   a collection of data points organized into a structured format
-   in this course, we will mainly work with datasets that are structured in a two-dimensional format
-   we will refer to these as *rectangular* datasets
-   rectangular datasets are organized into a series of rows and columns; ideally:
    -   we refer to rows as *observations*
    -   we refer to columns as *variables*

## Observations vs. Variables vs. Values {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: panel-tabset
### Observations

::: nonincremental
-   Observations refer to individual units or cases of the data being collected.
    -   If I was collecting data about each student in this course, one student would be an observation.
    -   If I was collecting census data and aggregating it at the county level, one county would be an observation.
:::

### Variables

::: nonincremental
-   Variables describe something about an observation.
    -   If I was collecting data about each student in this course, 'major' might be one variable.
    -   If I was collecting county-level census data, 'population' might be one variable.
:::

### Values

::: nonincremental
-   Values refer to the actual value associated with a variable for a given observation.
    -   If I was collecting data about each student's major in this course, one value might be SDS.

## How can we refer to certain rows, columns, or values in a dataset? {.smaller}

-   An *index* is a formal way of identifying the data at certain positions in a dataset.
-   Indexes are usually formatted as two numbers in brackets (e.g. \[3,4\]).
-   The first number refers to the row's position in the dataset. The second number refers to the column's position in the dataset.
    -   \[3,4\] will refer to the value three rows down and four rows over.
-   We can refer to an entire row of data by leaving the value in the second position of the index blank (e.g. \[3,\] will refer to the third row.)
-   We can refer to an entire column of data by leaving the value in the first position of the index blank (e.g. \[,4\] will refer to the fourth column)
    -   Alternatively, we can refer to a column by its column name.

## Key Considerations for Rectangular Datasets {.smaller}

::: columns
::: column
-   All rows in a rectangular dataset are of equal length.

-   All columns in a rectangular dataset are of equal length.

### Understanding Check

Let's say I have a rectangular dataset documenting student names and majors, and I was missing major information for one student. What would this look like in a rectangular dataset?

## Is this dataset rectangular?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=700}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rec_data1.png")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Is this a rectangular dataset?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=700}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rec_data2.png")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How do I find out more information about a dataset? {.smaller}

::: nonincremental
-   Metadata can be referred to as "data about data"
-   Metadata provides important contextual information to help us interpret a dataset.
-   There are two types of metadata associated with datasets:
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Administrative

::: nonincremental
-   Administrative metadata tells us how a dataset is managed and its *provenance*, or the history of how it came to be in its current form:
    -   Who created it?
    -   When was it created?
    -   When was it last updated?
    -   Who is permitted to use it?
:::

### Descriptive

::: nonincremental
-   Descriptive metadata tells us information about the contents of a dataset:
    -   What does each row refer to?
    -   What does each column refer to?
    -   What values might appear in each cell?
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Where do I find metadata for a dataset? {.smaller}

-   Oftentimes metadata is recorded in a dataset codebook or data dictionary.
-   These documents provide definitions for the observations and variables in a dataset and tell you the accepted values for each variable.
-   Let's say that I have a dataset of student names, majors, and class years. A codebook or data dictionary might tell me that:
    -   Each row in the dataset refers to one student.
    -   The 'Class Year' variable refers to "the year the student is expected to graduate."
    -   Possible values for the 'Major' variable are Political Science, SDS, and Sociology.

## Types of Variables

| Categorical Variables                                                             | Numeric Variables                                                               |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Nominal Variables: Named or classified labels (e.g. names, zip codes, hair color) | Discrete Variables: Countable variables (e.g. number of students in this class) |
| Ordinal Variables: Ordered labels (e.g. letter grades, pollution levels)          | Continuous Variables: Measured variables (e.g. temperature, height)             |
