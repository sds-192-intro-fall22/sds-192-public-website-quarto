	abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

	abstract = {Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents. Supplementary materials include an annotated set of links to step-by-step tutorials, real world examples, and other useful learning resources. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07639},
	abstract = {The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst constructs or creates a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. In addition, data analysts can prioritize (or not) certain objective characteristics in a data analysis, leading to differences in the quality or experience of the data analysis, such as an analysis that is more or less reproducible or an analysis that is more or less exhaustive. However, data analysts currently lack a formal mechanism to compare and contrast what makes analyses different from each other. To address this problem, we introduce a vocabulary to describe and characterize variation between data analyses. We denote this vocabulary as the elements and principles of data analysis, and we use them to describe the fundamental concepts for the practice and teaching of creating a data analysis. This leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data analyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to teach students how to build data analyses.},
