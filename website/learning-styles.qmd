I often get the question:

> How do I study for this class?

... and in the past I've sometimes struggled to answer that question because everyone learns differently. With this in mind, I've developed the following chart to help students figure out how best to study for this class given their personal learning style.

This chart is modeled based on research indexing different kinds of learning styles across four dimensions (active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, and sequential/global). This model was formulated by Richard M. Felder and Linda K. Silverman. Later, Richard M. Felder and Barbara A. Soloman developed an assessment tool for learning about a respondents' learning preferences.

As the first part of this assignment, you should take this assessment [here](https://www.engr.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/drive/1WPAfj3j5o5OuJMiHorJ-lv6fON1C8kCN/styles.pdf), and review your results against the descriptions of the dimensions [here](https://www.engr.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/drive/1WPAfj3j5o5OuJMiHorJ-lv6fON1C8kCN/styles.pdf).

Once you've reviewed your results, you can reference the following chart to see what I recommend in terms of your studying. Importantly, you should check out the study tips *along all four dimensions* (i.e. identify where you stand in each row of the table below). In the Study Plan assignment posted in Moodle, reflect on which study tips seem like they will be most supportive to you in 200-300 words.

It's important to note that these are just suggestions for directing your study habits. As with all indexes, this one has its limits. In writing up your response, focus on those suggestions that speak to you! Later in the semester, you will have an opportunity to reflect on how studying is going and adjust as necessary. Remember that I'm here to help you figure out how best to navigate this course!
