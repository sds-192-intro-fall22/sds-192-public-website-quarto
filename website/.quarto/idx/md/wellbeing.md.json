It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester.

If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the [Schacht Center](https://www.smith.edu/student-life/health-wellness).
