{"markdown":{"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"I hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other's struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\n* Check-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. \"What three words describe how you're feeling?\" \"Name one challenge and one success from this week.\" \"What are you doing for self-care right now?\" Thank each other for sharing where they're at.\n* Consider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking. \n* Acknowledge that there is much we don't know about how our colleagues experience the world. ...but don't ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of. \n* Cheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\n* Ask questions often in our `#sds-192-questions` channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can. \n* Mistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"principles-of-community.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.342","theme":"flatly","toc_float":{"collapsed":true,"smooth_scroll":false},"highlight":"tango","lib_dir":"libs"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
