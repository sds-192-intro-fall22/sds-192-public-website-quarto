Determine the unit of observation in your available data and its relevance to the question. \n5. Determine which variables in the available data are relevant to your question. \n6. Draw what your final data frame might look like. \n7. Get your data frame down to size! Compare the scope of what is requested in the question to what is requested in your data and subset accordingly. \n8. Wrangle! (This is the most variable step, and you'll need to have a handle on our data wrangling verbs.)\n9. Select the most relevant variables for final presentation. ",
