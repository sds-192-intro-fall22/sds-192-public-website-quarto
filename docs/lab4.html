<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There are many reasons that Git and GitHub are essential infrastructures for collaborative coding projects. For one Git saves snapshots of a code repository at different stages of a project so that we can track how it has changed over time and revert back to an older version if we discover a more recent error. We call this <em>version control</em>. Certain Git features also facilitate many people working on a coding project at once, by providing a number of tools to help prevent collaborators from over-writing each other’s work. These features also make it possible for developers to simultaneously modify, extend, and test components of the code without jeopardizing the project’s current functionality. Further, GitHub supports code publication; by publishing code on GitHub, you contribute to an open access/free software community, enabling others to learn from and build off of your work.</p>
<p>Despite all of these awesome benefits, there can be a significant learning curve when getting started with Git and GitHub. There are new vocabularies, workflows, and error mitigation strategies to learn when getting started. This lab is designed to help you get acquainted with the concepts behind Git and GitHub, suggested workflows for collaborating on projects in this course, and error resolution strategies.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="github-flow">GitHub Flow</h2>
<p>In my opinion, there are two kinds of workflows for GitHub. There’s the quick and dirty version, and there’s the long and elegant version. Below are the differences between these two workflows (don’t worry about if you don’t understand what the steps mean right now; we will learn all of them in the lab).</p>
<table class="table">

<li><p>Create a pull request at GitHub.com</p></li>
<li><p>Assign a reviewer to review the proposed changes and wait for their approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Merge changes, while also closing the issue and deleting the branch.</p></li>
</ol></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Typically I recommend the long and elegant version as it is designed to avoid errors and ensure that collaborators are all on the same page regarding changes to files. However, occasionally when you have to make small, quick changes to a file, and it won’t impact your team mate’s work, it will make more sense to follow the quick and dirty workflow. The goal for today is to get practice in the long and elegant version.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Navigate to _____ to accept the assignment. Enter your project group members.</p>
</div>

<p>This will create a GitHub repository called github-lab. You’ll notice that the repository has a few files - README.md, github-practice.Rmd, .gitingore. You’ll also notice in the repo’s right sidebar that your group members are listed as collaborators. This means that you all have access to read and write to this repository.</p>

Exercise 2
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>All group members should clone the repo to their RStudio environment. To do so, copy the repo’s URL. Then in RStudio click on File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git, and enter then pasted the copied URL into the window that appears. Note what you see in the RStudio files pane after cloning the repo.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Remember that cloning creates a copy of a remote repo on a local machine. In creating this project, you’ve copied all of the files that make up the github-lab repo at GitHub.com to your local computer. This means that you will find all of the files associated with this repo by navigating to the folder where you created the project on your computer.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this is not just any old folder on your computer though. By cloning, you’ve created a git folder. This means that the folder has been set up in a way where git can track the changes that you make to it over time, and it knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Issues support project planning by allowing you to track changes you hope to make to your project over time. By assigning issues to certain collaborators on your project team, you can have clear documentation of who is responsible for what.</p>

<p>In my own projects, I use Issues for a number of purposes. Sometimes I use Issues to bugs that I notice in my code that need to be fixed. Other times I use them to track features that I would like to add to my code down the road. Oftentimes, in my public repositories, I encourage others that are using my code to submit issues to ask questions about how something works, to report bugs, or to request features.</p>

<section id="branch" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="branch">Branch</h3>
<p>When you first create a repository all of the code will be stored in the <em>main</em> branch of the repository. If you were to think of a project like a tree growing up from the ground, then the main branch would be the like the trunk of the tree. One goal of a branching workflow in GitHub is to keep the most stable and polished versions of code in the main branch. So what do we do in the meantime - when we’re editing code and trying to sort out its bugs, and it’s not quite in that stable and polished state yet? That’s where branching comes in.</p>
<p>When we create a branch of our repo, GitHub creates a separate copy of the repo where you can make changes without impacting what’s in the main branch. Later, once we’re done making changes and things are stable and polished, we will have the opportunity to merge those changes back into the main branch.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Branching can get pretty wild in GitHub. You can have branches of branches of branches. I don’t recommend this. A good workflow is to create a branch for making specific changes, merge those changes back into main, delete the branch, and then create a new branch for the next batch of changes.</p>

<p>Click on the Code tab on your repo’s page at GitHub.com. Directly below this tab, you will see a dropdown that is currently labeled “main.” This means that you are in the main branch.

<p>As of right now, the branches that were created in the previous step only exist on GitHub.com, they don’t exist yet on your local machine. To get these changes to your local machine, you need to <strong>Pull</strong> the changes. Remember how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? When we pull changes to our local machines, we are basically saying, check that remote version for changes, and then pull them into the repo on my computer.</p>

<p>Head back to RStudio. In the Environment pane, you will notice a tab labeled “Git.” It’s important to note that this tab will only appear in projects that are built from super fancy git folders. This is your RStudio command center for Git and GitHub. When you click on this tab, you will see a few buttons in the navigation bar. To pull changes, you should click the blue downward arrow. Click this button to pull the branches created remotely to your local machine.</p>

<p>Even though you pulled the new branches to your local machine, you are still currently working in the main branch. Remember that we always want to keep the main branch stable and polished. This is not where we are going to make edits. Instead, you will make edits in the branch that you just created. Later, we will merge those changes back into the main branch.</p>

<p>Once in your branch, open github-practice.Rmd from the files pane. Decide within your group who will be Group member 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each group member should edit this file on their own machines by adding their name and only their group name to the appropriate location in the document (line 5, 7, or 9) based on their group member. <strong>It’s very important that this be the only section of the document you edit.</strong> Save the file by clicking File&gt;Save.</p>

<p>Sometimes we make a changes to a few files, save them, and we’re ready to create a snapshot of our repo (i.e.&nbsp;create a <strong>commit</strong>) with some of those changes. Remember that creating this snapshot is almost like taking a photo of the repo at this particular moment, allowing us to later go back to that photo to see what the repo looked like in that moment. To let Git know which changes we want to include in that snapshot, we need to stage the files. Staging basically says, “these files are ready to be included in the snapshot.”</p>

<p>Once you save the file you’ll notice in the RStudio Git pane that the file name appears after a blue square labeled “M” (which stands for Modified). This means that the file is ready for staging. Stage the file - indicating that it’s ready for committing - by clicking the checkbox in front of the file name.</p>

</section>
<section id="commit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="commit">Commit</h3>
<p>As we just noted, committing changes basically means taking a snapshot of a repo at a particular moment in time. Commits are given unique hashes - sort of like a unique identifier that enables us to access the snapshot of the repo at a later date. In collaborative projects, it is typically recommended to commit often - after any major changes are made to a file. This ensures that we can eventually go back to look at very specific changes. It’s also important to label commits with descriptive titles so that we can recall what changes within that commit.</p>
<p>To help put this into context, think back to our photograph metaphor. Let’s say that we are a photographer assigned to document how a baby develops in the first year of its life. If the photographer only took one photograph when the baby was 1 year old, we wouldn’t have a lot of documentation regarding how the baby developed! …so instead, let’s say that the photographer took a snapshot of the baby after every major milestone - their first laugh, their first solid food, their first crawl, their first word. We would have a lot more to go by when trying to understand how the baby developed. Same goes for committing code often.</p>
<p>Now let’s say the photographer handed the batch of photos to the parents, and said - “look, here’s how your baby developed over time.” The parents might not remember which photograph was taken after which milestone. …but if the photographer were to label each photograph with things like “baby had first laugh,” the parents would be able to easily go back to specific moments in their baby’s development. This is why we want descriptive commit messages. We want to later be able to go back and scan through what changes were made after each commit.</p>

<p>Only your local machine knows that a change has been made to the code. Remember again how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? Now we want to do the opposite of pulling changes from GitHub to our local machines. Instead, we want to push the changes on our local machines to GitHub.</p>

<p>A pull error occurs when changes have already been made to the same location (the same line number) in both a remote file and a local file, and then we try to pull the changes from the remote repo to our local machines. As far as Git can tell, there are two options for what this line is supposed to look like, and it can’t tell which to prioritize. So Git recommends that, as a first step, we commit the changes that we made locally. It’s basically saying, let’s take a snapshot of your local repo as it looks right now, so that later we can figure out what to do about this conflict.</p>
<p>If this seems confusing imagine this: let’s say you write a paper, and you share it with one of your classmates to review. The classmate reads through it, makes suggested changes to the opening sentence, and sends it back you. …but, while your classmate was reviewing the paper, you were getting antsy about the paper deadline and started making your own edits to the paper, including edits to the opening sentence. Now you’re trying to incorporate the changes from your classmate’s review, and you’re not sure what to do about that opening sentence. As a first step, you have two options you can scrap your recent changes (maybe your classmate’s suggestions were better!) or you can save a separate copy of the file with your recent changes and figure out later how to resolve the differences. That’s exactly what we are going to do here:</p>
<p><strong>To fix this error, you should stage and commit your local changes and then try pulling again.</strong> Let’s replicate this error:</p>

<p>Let’s return to the example of trying to incorporate a peer’s edits to a paper that you have recently made changes to. We have to figure out what to do about that opening sentence. Do we want our version, their version, or some combination of the two? This is what it is like to fix a merge conflict.</p>

<p>The code following HEAD represents the recent changes you made on your local machine, and the code right before the long string of characters represents the changes that were made in an earlier commit (the long string of characters is the commit hash). Decide what that line should look like and delete all other content.

Avoiding Merge Conflicts
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>You may have noticed that the most frustrating merge conflicts tend to emerge when we have two people working on the same line of a repo’s file. The most effective way to avoid merge conflicts is to ensure that collaborators are working on different documents or different lines in a file. One way you might do this when starting to work on your group project is to open a file that you all plan to work on and having one of your team mates section off space of that file for different people to work. It might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/avoiding-merge-conflict.png" class="img-fluid" alt="This image show an RMarkdown file with several lines for Collaborator 1 to work and several more lines for Collaborator 2 to work." width="300"></p>
<p>Once this change has been made, that group mate should stage, commit, and push the file to GitHub, and all other group mates should pull the change to their local machines.</p>

<p>I have been working with GitHub for years, and even to this day, I run into instances where things become so inconsistent between my local machine and the repo at GitHub.com that the fastest way to fix things is just to save local copies of the files that I’ve changed to somewhere else on my machine, delete the super fancy Git folder from its current location, and then re-clone the most up-to-date remote version to my local machine. Then I can figure out how I want to edit the most up-to-date version with my changes. This comic from XKCD captures this widely acknowledged solution beautifully:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" class="img-fluid" alt="This is a comic explaining why we sometimes just delete our local git repos and reclone."></p>

Ethical Considerations

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Increasingly, when data science researchers publish a paper in a journal, they are making the code they used to reach certain results freely available on GitHub.com for other researchers and the public to review. This is in part a response to the reproducibility crisis that you learned about in SDS 100. What do you see as the social benefits to making the code behind a data science finding publicly available online? What might be some of the social consequences of making this code freely available? How might we mitigate these consequences? Share your ideas on our <code>sds-192-discussions</code> Slack channel.</p>
