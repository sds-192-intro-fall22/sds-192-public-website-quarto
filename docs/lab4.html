<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There are many reasons that Git and GitHub are essential infrastructures for collaborative coding projects. For one Git saves snapshots of a code repository at different stages of a project so that we can track how it has changed over time and revert back to an older version if we discover a more recent error. We call this <em>version control</em>. Certain Git features also facilitate many people working on a coding project at once, by providing a number of tools to help prevent collaborators from over-writing each other’s work. These features also make it possible for developers to simultaneously modify, extend, and test components of the code without jeopardizing the project’s current functionality. Further, GitHub supports code publication; by publishing code on GitHub, you contribute to an open access/free software community, enabling others to learn from and build off of your work.</p>
<p>Despite all of these awesome benefits, there can be a significant learning curve when getting started with Git and GitHub. There are new vocabularies, workflows, and error mitigation strategies to learn when getting started. This lab is designed to help you get acquainted with the concepts behind Git and GitHub, suggested workflows for collaborating on projects in this course, and error resolution strategies.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Navigate to _____ to accept the assignment. Enter your project group members.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This will create a GitHub repository called github-lab. You’ll notice that the repository has a few files - README.md, github-practice.Rmd, .gitingore. You’ll also notice in the repo’s right sidebar that your group members are listed as collaborators. This means that you all have access to read and write to this repository.</p>

Exercise 2
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>All group members should clone the repo to their RStudio environment. To do so, copy the repo’s URL. Then in RStudio click on File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git, and enter then pasted the copied URL into the window that appears. Note what you see in the RStudio files pane after cloning the repo.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Remember that cloning creates a copy of a remote repo on a local machine. In creating this project, you’ve copied all of the files that make up the github-lab repo at GitHub.com to your local computer. This means that you will find all of the files associated with this repo by navigating to the folder where you created the project on your computer.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this is not just any old folder on your computer though. By cloning, you’ve created a git folder. This means that the folder has been set up in a way where git can track the changes that you make to it over time, and it knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with.</p>

<p>Navigate back to GitHub, and click on the repo’s Issues tab. Each member of your team should create an issue by clicking the ‘New Issue’ button. Title the issue: “Adding &lt;your name&gt; to the assignment.” Submit the issue, and to the left of the screen, assign the issue to yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Issues support project planning by allowing you to track changes you hope to make to your project over time. By assigning issues to certain collaborators on your project team, you can have clear documentation of who is responsible for what.</p>

<p>In my own projects, I use Issues for a number of purposes. Sometimes I use Issues to bugs that I notice in my code that need to be fixed. Other times I use them to track features that I would like to add to my code down the road. Oftentimes, in my public repositories, I encourage others that are using my code to submit issues to ask questions about how something works, to report bugs, or to request features.</p>

<section id="branch" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="branch">Branch</h3>
<p>When you first create a repository all of the code will be stored in the <em>main</em> branch of the repository. If you were to think of a project like a tree growing up from the ground, then the main branch would be the like the trunk of the tree. One goal of a branching workflow in GitHub is to keep the most stable and polished versions of code in the main branch.</p>
<p>So what do we do in the meantime - when we’re editing code and trying to sort out its bugs, and it’s not quite in that stable and polished state yet? That’s where branching comes in.</p>
<p>When we create a branch of our repo, GitHub creates a separate copy of the repo where you can make changes without impacting what’s in the main branch. Later, once we’re down making changes and things are stable and polised, we will have the opportunity to merge those changes back into the main branch.</p>
<div class="callout-tip callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Branching can get pretty wild in GitHub. You can have branches of branches of branches. I don’t recommend this. A good workflow is to create a branch for making specific changes, merge those changes back into main, delete the branch, and then create a new branch for the next batch of changes.</p>

Exercise 4
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Click on the Code tab on your repo’s page at GitHub.com. Directly below this tab, you will see a dropdown that is currently labeled “main.” This means that you are in the main branch. Each member of your team should click the down arrow, and create a branch by entering their first name into the textbox that appears, and then clicking “Create branch.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="pull" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pull">Pull</h3>
<p>As of right now, the branches that were created in the previous step only exist on GitHub.com, they don’t exist yet on your local machine. To get these changes to your local machine, you need to <strong>Pull</strong> the changes. Remember how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? When we pull changes to our local machines, we are basically saying, check that remote version for changes, and then pull them into the repo on my computer.</p>

Exercise 5
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Head back to RStudio. In the Environment pane, you will notice a tab labeled “Git.” It’s important to note that this tab will only appear in projects that are built from super fancy git folders. This is your RStudio command center for Git and GitHub. When you click on this tab, you will see a few buttons in the navigation bar. To pull changes, you should click the blue downward arrow. Click this button to pull the branches created remotely to your local machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="switch-branches" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="switch-branches">Switch Branches</h3>
<p>Even though you pulled the new branches to your local machine, you are still currently working in the main branch. Remember that we always want to keep the main branch stable and polished. This is not where we are going to make edits. Instead, you will make edits in the branch that you just created. Later, we will merge those changes back into the main branch.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In the top right hand corner of the Git tab, you will see a dropdown currently set to “main”. Click the downward arrow, and switch to your branch by selecting the appropriate branch.</p>

Exercise 7
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Once in your branch, open github-practice.Rmd from the files pane. Decide within your group who will be Group member 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each group member should edit this file on their own machines by adding their name to the appropriate location in the document based on their group member. <strong>It’s very important that this be the only section of the document you edit.</strong> Save the file by clicking File&gt;Save.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="stage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stage">Stage</h3>
<p>Sometimes we make a changes to a few files, save them, and we’re ready to create a snapshot of our repo (i.e.&nbsp;create a <strong>commit</strong>) with some of those changes. Remember that creating this snapshot is almost like taking a photo of the repo at this particular moment, allowing us to later go back to that photo to see what the repo looked like in that moment. To let Git know which changes we want to include in that snapshot, we need to stage the files. Staging basically says, “these files are ready to be included in the snapshot.”</p>

<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
Exercise 8
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Once you save the file you’ll notice in the RStudio Git pane that the file name appears after a blue square labeled “M” (which stands for Modified). This means that the file is ready for staging. Stage the file - indicating that it’s ready for committing - by clicking the checkbox in front of the file name.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="commit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="commit">Commit</h3>
<p>As we just noted, committing changes basically means taking a snapshot of a repo at a particular moment in time. Commits are given unique hashes - sort of like a unique identifier that enables us to access the snapshot of the repo at a later date. In collaborative projects, it is typically recommended to commit often - after any major changes are made to a file. This ensures that we can eventually go back to look at very specific changes. It’s also important to label commits with descriptive titles so that we can recall what changes within that commit.</p>
<p>To help put this into context, think back to our photograph metaphor. Let’s say that we are a photographer assigned to document how a baby develops in the first year of its life. If the photographer only took one photograph when the baby was 1 year old, we wouldn’t have a lot of documentation regarding how the baby developed! …so instead, let’s say that the photographer took a snapshot of the baby after every major milestone - their first laugh, their first solid food, their first crawl, their first word. We would have a lot more to go by when trying to understand how the baby developed. Same goes for committing code often.</p>
<p>Now let’s say the photographer handed the batch of photos to the parents, and said - “look, here’s how your baby developed over time.” The parents might not remember which photograph was taken after which milestone. …but if the photographer were to label each photograph with things like “baby had first laugh,” the parents would be able to easily go back to specific moments in their baby’s development. This is why we want descriptive commit messages.</p>

Exercise 9
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Commit your changes by clicking the ‘Commit’ button in the Git pane. When you click this button, a new window will open showcasing the changes that have been made to the staged file. You should enter a commit message in the window that appears. Remember that commit messages should be descriptive. In this case, something like “added &lt;your-name&gt;’s name” would work. Click commit. Now a snapshot of this version of the code repo has been taken.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="push" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="push">Push</h3>
<p>Only your local machine knows that a change has been made to the code. Remember again how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? Now we want to do the opposite of pulling changes from GitHub to our local mahchines. Instead, we want to push the changes on our local machines to GitHub.</p>

Exercise 10
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Click the Green upward arrow in the Git pane to push your changes to GitHub. Once all group members have pushed their changes, head back over to GitHub. On the main code page, switch between branches and check out the contents of github-practice.Rmd in each branch. What differences do you notice?</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="pull-request" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pull-request">Pull Request</h3>
<p>Note that that now we have a few versions of our repo in separate branches on GitHub.com, and in each of those versions of the repo, the github-practice.Rmd file looks a little bit different. Now that we’ve made our changes and things are stable and polished, we want to move all of those changes into the main branch. To do this, we are going to issue a <strong>Pull Request</strong>. This is a request that signals to all of our collaborators that we are ready to move our changes back into the main branch.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>On your repo’s page in GitHub.com, click the “Pull Requests” tab, and then click the green “New Pull Request” button. You’re requesting to pull the changes from your personal branch into the main branch. This means that the <em>base</em> branch should be main, and the <em>compare</em> branch should be your personal branch. You’ll see a screen where you can compare your branch to the main branch. Click the button to “Create Pull Request,” enter a descriptive title of the changes made, and then click “Create Pull Request” again.</p>
