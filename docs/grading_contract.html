<p>This course will be graded using a standards-based assessment system. In a more traditional grading system, your scores on a series of assignments are averaged over the course of the semester. In this course, rather than assessing and averaging your achievement on particular assignments, I will instead be assessing the development of your fluency in a set of pre-defined standards. You will have multiple opportunities over the course of the semester to showcase the depth of your understanding regarding these standards. A standards-based grading system carries the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning targets for the course are clearly defined from the outset, and almost every graded assignment that you receive will be directly tied to at least one standard. This should make it abundantly clear what skills and competencies I’m assessing on each assignment. There is no “busy work” with a standards-based system.</li>
<li>No one assignment will make-or-break your grade. You have multiple opportunities to demonstrate fluency in a standard. This rewards students that take the time to practice and learn from their mistakes. It prioritizes student growth throughout the course of the semester and allows for us all to have off-days.</li>
<li>Assessments in a standards-based system are much clearer than in a point-based grading system. Saying that I’ve become proficient in data wrangling, joining, and visualizing means more than saying that I earned a 92.5 in my Introduction to Data Science course. Further, when approaching me about how to improve your grade in the course, we can focus our conversation more on how to deepen certain skills and competencies rather than how to hit certain numeric benchmarks.</li>
<li>A standards-based grading system makes it easier to monitor your progress towards a certain grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my second iteration of teaching a standards-based course, and I’ve made several revisions from the first iteration based on what I’ve learned from experience and student feedback. I’m excited to refine this system this semester as I believe it aligns with my overarching goals for the course. In this course, I find it far more important that you come away with an understanding of the concepts behind core data science strategies (along with an ability to find and interpret reference materials) than it is to demonstrate memorization of <code>R</code> syntax. Developing this understanding will empower you to learn and apply new data science languages on your own.</p>

<p>5PM (close of business day) will be the cut-off time for all assignments in this course. The reason I’ve set the deadlines to 5PM is that I’d like to discourage students from staying up late into the night to complete assignments. Note that there is a 24-hour grace period for submitting <u>labs and project assignments</u>. This means that you will still get full credit for these assignments as long as they are submitted by 5PM the day following the assignment due date. However, <u>quizzes and course advancement assignments</u> must be submitted by 5PM <em>on the due date</em> for credit.</p>

<p>In most weeks, you will be assigned a lab, which you will start in class and complete at home. There will be one lab per standard. Labs will be designed to help you practice applying the course standards towards the analysis of a dataset. You may work on labs in groups, but all group members should submit their own lab. Labs will be <strong>graded for completion</strong>, and you can earn 3 points per standard by completing the lab associated with that standard. All sections of the lab must be completed in good faith to earn these points.</p>

<p>There will be 3 projects, to be completed in groups of 3-4, assigned over the course of the semester. In each you will have an opportunity to demonstrate fluency in standards we have covered up to that point in the semester. I will provide prompts for each project, but you will have a lot of flexibility to demonstrate your own creativity and explore your own interests in designing a project around the prompt. You can earn up to 3 points towards 9 of the ten standards based on your project submission. If you don’t earn full credit on a standard for a project submission, you may improve your score on that standard in the next project. The only standard that won’t be covered in projects is <strong>Data Retrieval</strong>, which we will cover too late in the semester to work into projects. Projects will be <strong>graded for fluency</strong>.</p>

<p>There will be 3 quizzes administered throughout the semester - each assessing 3-4 course standards.

In this sense, quizzes will be <strong>graded for fluency.</strong></p>
<p>Quizzes will be taken at home, administered in Moodle, and are open book/open Internet. You may start a quiz at any time before its due date, but it must be completed by its due date in order to earn credit. Please note that extensions will not be granted for quizzes.</p>
